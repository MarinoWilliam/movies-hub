# Movies Hub

Welcome to the movies-hub repository! This project aims to provide a fully functional backend with detailed documentation, including user authentication using JWT. Unfortunately, the frontend part of the project is still under construction and was not able to be completed in time.

## Backend

The backend of this project is mostly complete and includes the following:

- **User Authentication**: JWT-based user sign-up and sign-in functionality.
- **API Endpoints**: A set of well-defined API endpoints for handling various backend operations.
- **Database Integration**: Backend is integrated with a database for data storage and management.
- **Detailed Documentation**: Complete and detailed documentation is included to help you understand how the backend works and how to interact with it.


## Frontend

Unfortunately, the frontend part of the project is still under construction and has not been completed yet. The focus was primarily on building the backend, which is mostly ready for use. We hope to continue developing the frontend in the future.



## Future Work

- The frontend will be implemented soon.
- The project will be updated with new features and improvements over time.

Thank you for checking out the project! We appreciate your understanding as we continue to build and improve it.
